This project, supervised by tutors Andrés Alberto Aristizábal Pinzón PhD and Uram Aníbal Sosa Aguirre PhD, as well as advisor Rodrigo Ordoñez MD. Epidemiologist, is an endeavor undertaken by Isabella Ortiz Jaramillo and Sean Quintero Ordoñez at the Universidad Icesi, Facultad de Ingeniería, Ingeniería de sistemas, Santiago de Cali. The project aimed to build a predictive model for classifying the risk of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD).

The project focuses on the department of Nariño, allowing for a sample population with similar demographic, cultural, and ethnic characteristics. The importance of this work is underlined by the high incidence of CKD patients who remain undiagnosed until the advanced stages of the disease. According to the IHME, the CKD burden in Colombia rose from ninth to seventh place from 2000 to 2015 (SARMIENTO-BEJARANO, 2019).

The main goal is to construct a predictive model that allows for risk classification among patients between 18 and 69 years who might suffer from CKD in the department of Nariño. We used the CRISP-DM (Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) methodology, a hierarchical model based on the data science process, and followed its six sequential phases to carry out this project.
