Getting Started
=================

To use the CKD prediction project, please follow these steps:

1. **Environment Setup:**

    The project requires a Python environment (Python 3.6+ recommended). If Python is not installed, download it from the official website (https://www.python.org/). We also recommend using a virtual environment. You can set up one using venv (comes with Python3.6+).

2. **Project Clone:**

    Clone the project from its repository. You can do this by running `git clone <repository_url>` in your command line, replacing `<repository_url>` with the project's repository URL.

3. **Install Dependencies:**

    The project has some dependencies which are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. To install these dependencies, navigate to the root directory of the project and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

4. **Running the Project:**

    After successfully installing the dependencies, you can run the project. Navigate to the project's root directory, then use Python to run the main file with `python <main_file>.py`, replacing `<main_file>` with the main Python file of the project.

If you need help with the project or encounter any issues, feel free to reach out to us or raise an issue in the project repository.
